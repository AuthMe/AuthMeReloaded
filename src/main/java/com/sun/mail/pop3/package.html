<BODY BGCOLOR="white">

A POP3 protocol provider for the JavaMail API
that provides access to a POP3 message store.
Refer to <A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1939.txt" TARGET="_top">
RFC 1939</A>
for more information.
<P>
The POP3 provider provides a Store object that contains a single Folder
named "INBOX". Due to the limitations of the POP3 protocol, many of
the JavaMail API capabilities like event notification, folder management,
flag management, etc. are not allowed.  The corresponding methods throw
the MethodNotSupportedException exception; see below for details.
<P>
Note that JavaMail does <strong>not</strong> include a local store into
which messages can be downloaded and stored.  See our
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/javamail/Third_Party.html" TARGET="_top">
Third Party Products</A>
web page for availability of "mbox" and "MH" local store providers.
<P>
The POP3 provider is accessed through the JavaMail APIs by using the protocol
name "pop3" or a URL of the form "pop3://user:password@host:port/INBOX".
<P>
POP3 supports only a single folder named "INBOX".
<P>
POP3 supports <strong>no</strong> permanent flags (see
{@link javax.mail.Folder#getPermanentFlags Folder.getPermanentFlags()}).
In particular, the <code>Flags.Flag.RECENT</code> flag will never be set
for POP3
messages.  It's up to the application to determine which messages in a
POP3 mailbox are "new".  There are several strategies to accomplish
this, depending on the needs of the application and the environment:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
A simple approach would be to keep track of the newest
message seen by the application.
</LI>
<LI>
An alternative would be to keep track of the UIDs (see below)
of all messages that have been seen.
</LI>
<LI>
Another approach is to download <strong>all</strong> messages into a local
mailbox, so that all messages in the POP3 mailbox are, by
definition, new.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
All approaches will require some permanent storage associated with the client.
<P>
POP3 does not support the <code>Folder.expunge()</code> method.  To delete and
expunge messages, set the <code>Flags.Flag.DELETED</code> flag on the messages
and close the folder using the <code>Folder.close(true)</code> method.  You
cannot expunge without closing the folder.
<P>
POP3 does not provide a "received date", so the <code>getReceivedDate</code>
method will return null.
It may be possible to examine other message headers (e.g., the
"Received" headers) to estimate the received date, but these techniques
are error-prone at best.
<P>
The POP3 provider supports the POP3 UIDL command, see
{@link com.sun.mail.pop3.POP3Folder#getUID POP3Folder.getUID()}.
You can use it as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
if (folder instanceof com.sun.mail.pop3.POP3Folder) {
    com.sun.mail.pop3.POP3Folder pf =
	(com.sun.mail.pop3.POP3Folder)folder;
    String uid = pf.getUID(msg);
    if (uid != null)
	... // use it
}
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
You can also pre-fetch all the UIDs for all messages like this:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
FetchProfile fp = new FetchProfile();
fp.add(UIDFolder.FetchProfileItem.UID);
folder.fetch(folder.getMessages(), fp);
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Then use the technique above to get the UID for each message.  This is
similar to the technique used with the UIDFolder interface supported by
IMAP, but note that POP3 UIDs are strings, not integers like IMAP
UIDs.  See the POP3 spec for details.
<P>
When the headers of a POP3 message are accessed, the POP3 provider uses
the TOP command to fetch all headers, which are then cached.  Use of the
TOP command can be disabled with the <CODE>mail.pop3.disabletop</CODE>
property, in which case the entire message content is fetched with the
RETR command.
<P>
When the content of a POP3 message is accessed, the POP3 provider uses
the RETR command to fetch the entire message.  Normally the message
content is cached in memory.  By setting the
<CODE>mail.pop3.filecache.enable</CODE> property, the message content
will instead be cached in a temporary file.  The file will be removed
when the folder is closed.  Caching message content in a file is generally
slower, but uses substantially less memory and may be helpful when dealing
with very large messages.
<P>
The {@link com.sun.mail.pop3.POP3Message#invalidate POP3Message.invalidate}
method can be used to invalidate cached data without closing the folder.
Note that if the file cache is being used the data in the file will be
forgotten and fetched from the server if it's needed again, and stored again
in the file cache.
<P>
The POP3 CAPA command (defined by
<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2449.txt" TARGET="_top">RFC 2449</A>)
will be used to determine the capabilities supported by the server.
Some servers don't implement the CAPA command, and some servers don't
return correct information, so various properties are available to
disable use of certain POP3 commands, including CAPA.
<P>
If the server advertises the PIPELINING capability (defined by
<A HREF="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2449.txt" TARGET="_top">RFC 2449</A>),
or the <CODE>mail.pop3.pipelining</CODE> property is set, the POP3
provider will send some commands in batches, which can significantly
improve performance and memory use.
Some servers that don't support the CAPA command or don't advertise
PIPELINING may still support pipelining; experimentation may be required.
<P>
If pipelining is supported and the connection is using
SSL, the USER and PASS commands will be sent as a batch.
(If SSL is not being used, the PASS command isn't sent
until the user is verified to avoid exposing the password
if the user name is bad.)
<P>
If pipelining is supported, when fetching a message with the RETR command,
the LIST command will be sent as well, and the result will be used to size
the I/O buffer, greatly reducing memory usage when fetching messages.
<P>
The POP3 protocol provider supports the following properties,
which may be set in the JavaMail <code>Session</code> object.
The properties are always set as strings; the Type column describes
how the string is interpreted.  For example, use
<PRE>
	props.put("mail.pop3.port", "888");
</PRE>
to set the <CODE>mail.pop3.port</CODE> property, which is of type int.
<P>
Note that if you're using the "pop3s" protocol to access POP3 over SSL,
all the properties would be named "mail.pop3s.*".

Defaults to false.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.pop3.disablecapa</TD>
<TD>boolean</TD>
<TD>
If set to true, the POP3 CAPA command will not be used to fetch
server capabilities.  This is useful for POP3 servers that don't
properly implement the CAPA command, or that provide incorrect
information in the CAPA command results.
Defaults to false.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.pop3.forgettopheaders</TD>
<TD>boolean</TD>
<TD>
If set to true, the headers that might have been retrieved using
the POP3 TOP command will be forgotten and replaced by headers
retrieved as part of the POP3 RETR command.  Some servers, such
as some versions of Microsft Exchange and IBM Lotus Notes,
will return slightly different
headers each time the TOP or RETR command is used.  To allow the
POP3 provider to properly parse the message content returned from
the RETR command, the headers also returned by the RETR command
must be used.  Setting this property to true will cause these
headers to be used, even if they differ from the headers returned
previously as a result of using the TOP command.
Defaults to false.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.pop3.filecache.enable</TD>
<TD>boolean</TD>
<TD>
If set to true, the POP3 provider will cache message data in a temporary
file rather than in memory.  Messages are only added to the cache when
accessing the message content.  Message headers are always cached in
memory (on demand).  The file cache is removed when the folder is closed
or the JVM terminates.
Defaults to false.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.pop3.filecache.dir</TD>
<TD>String</TD>
<TD>
If the file cache is enabled, this property can be used to override the
default directory used by the JDK for temporary files.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.pop3.cachewriteto</TD>
<TD>boolean</TD>
<TD>
Controls the behavior of the
{@link com.sun.mail.pop3.POP3Message#writeTo writeTo} method
on a POP3 message object.
If set to true, and the message content hasn't yet been cached,
and ignoreList is null, the message is cached before being written.
Otherwise, the message is streamed directly
to the output stream without being cached.
Defaults to false.
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD>mail.pop3.keepmessagecontent</TD>
<TD>boolean</TD>
<TD>
The content of a message is cached when it is first fetched.
Normally this cache uses a {@link java.lang.ref.SoftReference SoftReference}
to refer to the cached content.  This allows the cached content to be purged
if memory is low, in which case the content will be fetched again if it's
needed.
If this property is set to true, a hard reference to the cached content
will be kept, preventing the memory from being reused until the folder
is closed or the cached content is explicitly invalidated (using the
{@link com.sun.mail.pop3.POP3Message#invalidate invalidate} method).
(This was the behavior in previous versions of JavaMail.)
Defaults to false.
</TD>
</TR>

</TABLE>
<P>
In general, applications should not need to use the classes in this
package directly.  Instead, they should use the APIs defined by
<code>javax.mail</code> package (and subpackages).  Applications should
never construct instances of <code>POP3Store</code> or
<code>POP3Folder</code> directly.  Instead, they should use the
<code>Session</code> method <code>getStore</code> to acquire an
appropriate <code>Store</code> object, and from that acquire
<code>Folder</code> objects.
<P>
In addition to printing debugging output as controlled by the
{@link javax.mail.Session Session} configuration,
the com.sun.mail.pop3 provider logs the same information using
{@link java.util.logging.Logger} as described in the following table:
