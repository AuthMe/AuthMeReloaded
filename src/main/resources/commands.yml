# This configuration file allows you to execute commands on various events.
# Supported placeholders in commands:
#   %p is replaced with the player name.
#   %nick is replaced with the player's nick name
#   %ip is replaced with the player's IP address
#   %country is replaced with the player's country
# 
# For example, if you want to send a welcome message to a player who just registered:
# onRegister:
#   welcome:
#     command: 'msg %p Welcome to the server!'
#     executor: CONSOLE
# 
# This will make the console execute the msg command to the player.
# Each command under an event has a name you can choose freely (e.g. 'welcome' as above),
# after which a mandatory 'command' field defines the command to run,
# and 'executor' defines who will run the command (either PLAYER or CONSOLE). Longer example:
# onLogin:
#   welcome:
#     command: 'msg %p Welcome back!'
#     executor: PLAYER
#   broadcast:
#     command: 'broadcast %p has joined, welcome back!'
#     executor: CONSOLE
# 
# Supported command events: onLogin, onSessionLogin, onFirstLogin, onJoin, onLogout, onRegister, onUnregister
# 
# For onLogin and onFirstLogin, you can use 'ifNumberOfAccountsLessThan' and 'ifNumberOfAccountsAtLeast'
# to specify limits to how many accounts a player can have (matched by IP) for a command to be run:
# onLogin:
#   warnOnManyAccounts:
#     command: 'say Uh oh! %p has many alt accounts!'
#     executor: CONSOLE
#     ifNumberOfAccountsAtLeast: 5
# Commands to run for players logging in whose 'last login date' was empty
onFirstLogin: {}
onJoin: {}
onLogin: {}
# These commands are called whenever a logged in player uses /logout or quits.
# The commands are not run if a player that was not logged in quits the server.
# Note: if your server crashes, these commands won't be run, so don't rely on them to undo
# 'onLogin' commands that would be dangerous for non-logged in players to have!
onLogout: {}
onRegister: {}
onSessionLogin: {}
# Commands to run whenever a player is unregistered (by himself, or by an admin)
onUnregister: {}
