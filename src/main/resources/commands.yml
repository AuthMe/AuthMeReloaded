# This configuration file allows you to execute commands on various events.
# Supported placeholders in commands:
#   %p is replaced with the player name.
#   %nick is replaced with the player's nick name
#   %ip is replaced with the player's IP address
#   %country is replaced with the player's country
# 
# For example, if you want to send a welcome message to a player who just registered:
# onRegister:
#   welcome:
#     command: 'msg %p Welcome to the server!'
#     executor: CONSOLE
# 
# This will make the console execute the msg command to the player.
# Each command under an event has a name you can choose freely (e.g. 'welcome' as above),
# after which a mandatory 'command' field defines the command to run,
# and 'executor' defines who will run the command (either PLAYER or CONSOLE). Longer example:
# onLogin:
#   welcome:
#     command: 'msg %p Welcome back!'
#     executor: PLAYER
#   broadcast:
#     command: 'broadcast %p has joined, welcome back!'
#     executor: CONSOLE
# 
# Supported command events: onLogin, onJoin, onRegister, onUnregister
onJoin: {}
onLogin: {}
onRegister: {}
# Commands to run whenever a player is unregistered (by himself, or by an admin)
onUnregister: {}
