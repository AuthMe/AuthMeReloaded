## AuthMe Configuration
The first time you run AuthMe it will create a config.yml file in the plugins/AuthMe folder, 
with which you can configure various settings. This following is the initial contents of
the generated config.yml file.

```yml
{config}
```

To change settings on a running server, save your changes to config.yml and use 
`/authme reload`.
